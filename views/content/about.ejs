                <h2>Little bit about me</h2>
                <p> I’m a UX Designer and Developer living in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. I study Communication &amp; Multimedia Design at the Hogeschool van Amsterdam and in my free time I love playing videogames, occasionally making drawings and digitalising them. </p>
                <p> The two traits that define me is being annoyingly organised and being a perfectionist. I like to make a plan that is well structured in order to achieve a goal that has been set, but i’m also flexible enough to adjust this plan if necessary. Because I’m a perfectionist I don’t stop until I’m satisfied with my work and I always aim for something better so that I can outdo myself. </p>

                <h2>I'm a <span>Webdesigner</span></h2>
                    <p>I believe that creating a good visual design also contributes to serving a good user experience. It guides the users through the webpage and it will help them find what they are looking for. As a UX'er I'm aspired to bring the best user experience possible.</p>

                <h2>I'm a <span>Crazy Coder</span></h2>
                <p>Another fundamental part of UX is Front-End Development. It's one thing to build a website, it's another thing to make it accessible for everybody regardless of disabilities, using a very old computer/browser or having slow internet connection. As a code nerd I take all these aspects into account to provide accessibility.</p>
