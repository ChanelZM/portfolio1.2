            <p>
                Redesign the Experience Conference webpage and logo in your image.

            <h2>Process</h2>
            <p>
                During my internship at ING, they gave me an assignment to redesign the Experience Conference page. I could design it in my image but inside the boundaries of ING's styleguide.

                XD Conference is about creating better costumer experience in the digital world. I wanted to design something that said "creativity" so I thought of dripping paint and using ING's primary colors.
