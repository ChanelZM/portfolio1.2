<h2>Design Challenge</h2>
<p>
  Create a second screen for an excisting tv show that provides a richer user experience
</p>
<h2>Process</h2>
<p>
  As you can see I slightly went off course by making a second screen for a game instead of a tv show. I like games
</p>
<p>
  Before designing and developing, I did some user research to find out what feature of the game could do better. An example was that players missed some kind of character customization in Zombie mode
</p>
<p>
  Then I used the research to form a concept and find design patterns that would suit the concept.
</p>
<p>
  After making a wireframe, I looked at some styles that would match the games, because I wanted to be consistent. After all, the second screen should feel like a part of the game.
</p>
<p>
  The last step in the process was developing the designs into a website. It's a prototype so it's not syncing with the game but it is full responsive.
